Another pygame test, this time using a more direct pixel access, rather
than going through a numpy array. Here, we give the C code a traditional
contiguous memory buffer to draw on.

The only issue with the approach implemented here is the python code
allocates a middle-man draw buffer for the C code to draw onto. Ideally
we could give the C code direct access to the SDL surfaces' scanlines.
It can surely be done, just need to figure out how to pull the pointer
to the surface's pixels and get it down to the C code.

Note that a lot of this direct buffer stuff doesn't hide the surface
pitch away at all, so we still need to mind it when accessing the
surface's pixels.

When running, hit "f" to show the framerate. Escape to quit.

Requirements:
